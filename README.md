# Which-Door-Did-Done-It-
"Which Door Did Done It" is a pixel-art puzzle game inspired by the classic board game Clue, combined with a variation of the famous “three-door probability” riddle. Players navigate through mysterious rooms by solving riddles and choosing the correct door to progress.

Gameplay Overview
The game consists of five visually distinct rooms, each designed with a unique 1990s-style pixelated look and a dark, mysterious color palette.

Players are presented with a riddle containing clues to select the correct door among several doors.

Selecting the correct door allows the player to progress to the next room.

Choosing an incorrect door forces the player to try again in the current room.

A timer of 1.5 minutes counts down in each room, adding urgency to the puzzle-solving.

Fonts throughout the game use the classic Courier New typeface, enhancing the retro feel.
